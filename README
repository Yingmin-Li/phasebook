ABOUT
===== 
Phasebook is a script to automate the retrieving of Facebook user's records in JSON format via Facebook's Open Graphs API and depositing them into CouchDB. It was written after I learning about Ron of SkullSecurity's research in revealing Facebook user's data. (see ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS below) It should serve as (another) wake up call to those that think their data is being protected once it has been entered into Facebook. While people using Facebook need to opt-out in order to not share their data, are they aware that any 'public' data is not only available on the site, but to anyone that wants to use the open API? What bounderies exist on the data at that point? 


REQUIREMENTS
============
* git
* curl
* couchdb

if you use Debian like me you can satisfy these requirements with the following command:
	apt-get install git curl couchdb


USAGE
=====
git clone git://github.com/philcryer/phasebook.git
cd phasebook
vi phasebook.sh 
	* modify variables to match your enviroment
./phasebook.sh
	* view results in CouchDB's futon
